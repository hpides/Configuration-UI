	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
	#ServerName www.example.com

	# Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,

	# It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular

	#LogLevel info ssl:warn

	# For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are

	# following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
	# after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
